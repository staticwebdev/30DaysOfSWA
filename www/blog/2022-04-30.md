On May 12, 2021, the [Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview?WT.mc_id=30daysofswa-61155-cxall) service hit a significant milestone - [becoming generally available](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/azure-static-web-apps-is-now-generally-available/?WT.mc_id=30daysofswa-61155-cxall) with support for many of the popular [front-end frameworks and static site generators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/front-end-frameworks) used for modern web app development.

On May 12, 2022, Azure Static Web Apps will make the first-year anniversary of that milestone - making this the perfect time to look back on all the progress made, and look ahead to what's in store next.
