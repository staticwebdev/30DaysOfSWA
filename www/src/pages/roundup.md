## üóì | Monthly Roundup

:::info Lets talk about #ThisMonthInSWA

Welcome to **This Month In SWA** - a monthly roundup of [Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview) news and updates from the Product Team, Cloud & Student Advocacy - and from you, our amazing Developer Community. 
 * Visit [**#ThisMonthInSWA**](/thismonth) to view past issues.
 * Subscribe to the [**RSS Feed**](/thismonth/rss.xml) to get new issues directly!
:::

When we wrapped the [#30DaysOfSWA](roadmap) series in June 2022, we many of you continuing to stop by the site for content updates. There are many resources you can track individually:
 * Follow the [**#staticwebapps tag on dev.to**](https://dev.to/t/staticwebapps) for community posts
 * Follow the [**StaticWebApps topic on TechCommunity**](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/bg-p/AppsonAzureBlog/label-name/Static%20Web%20Apps) for product team and advocacy posts
 * Follow the [**@AzureStaticApps handle on Twitter**](https://twitter.com/AzureStaticApps) for news on upcoming events & announcements

But we thought it might help if we had a _round up_ of all the key news and content updates in a single montly post for convenient reading. That's the origin story for **#ThisMonthInSWA**. We hope to cover:

 * üóì | ** Events**: Past and Upcoming, featuring SWA talks or training opportunities.
 * üì¢ | **Announcements**: Latest news or updates from the Product and Engineering teams.
 * üëÄ | **Content Updates**: New articles, tutorials or samples authored by Microsoft developers.
 * üêù | **Community Buzz**: New articles, tutorials or samples authored by Community developers 
 * üåü | **Spotlight**: Featuring a project or person that makes a difference to SWA developers.

##  üöÄ | Content Collections 

:::info üÜï LEARN WITH CONTENT COLLECTIONS

Welcome to **[Content Collections](/collections)** - a new feature on this site that bundles a relevant set of posts or resources into a short collection that can help you skill up on a specific topic!
 * Bookmark [**the collections page**](/collections) and revisit it for updates
 * We will _spotlight_ new collections on #ThisMonthInSWA so [**subscribe to the RSS Feed**](https://www.azurestaticwebapps.dev/thismonth/rss.xml)
:::

When we created the [#30DaysOfSWA](roadmap) series, we deliberately designed a content plan with _themed weeks_ focused on a specific topic. Now, we are packaging these into **collections** - short content bundles that provide a deep dive into a particular topic or theme, that you can reuse, refer to, or compose into custom roadmaps.

We also realized this was a good way to provide a comprehensive _content bundle_ to skill you up on new features on their debut - giving you a way to go from the launch announcement, to the documentation, to new tutorials and video resources that enhance your understanding.
