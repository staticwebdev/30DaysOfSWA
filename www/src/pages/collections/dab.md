# Database Connections: Content Collection

Modern web applications rely on scalable and cost-effective access to databases from their front-end experiences. Implementing the backend services to handle data interactions can be complex and repetitive. Wouldn't it be great if we could seamlessly access Azure databases using REST and GraphQL, without writing backend code?

Now, you can! Join us for a week of exploration related to _Database Connections For Azure Static Web Apps_ - **check back daily for a new resource to help you learn more about this feature!**

:::tip WE VALUE YOUR FEEDBACK!
