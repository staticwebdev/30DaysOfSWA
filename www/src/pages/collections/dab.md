# Database Connections: Content Collection

Modern web applications rely on scalable and cost-effective access to databases from their front-end experiences. Implementing the backend services to handle data interactions can be complex and repetitive. Wouldn't it be great if we could seamlessly access Azure databases using REST and GraphQL, without writing backend code?

Now, you can! Join us for a week of exploration related to _Database Connections For Azure Static Web Apps_ - **check back daily for a new resource to help you learn more about this feature!**

## 3. Blazor SWA + GraphQL

:::success DIVE INTO: GRAPHQL ON AZURE
_Database Connections_ can support both REST and GraphQL endpoints for access. Want to explore GraphQL on Azure? Check out [**this ongoing series of posts**](https://www.aaron-powell.com/posts/2020-07-13-graphql-on-azure-part-1-getting-started/) from Microsoft Cloud Advocate [Aaron Powell](https://github.com/aaronpowell).
:::

Today, Aaron is sharing 3 new posts in the series that provide more hands-on learning for using Database Connections in your modern web app.

1. [**Part 12: GraphQL as a Service**](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/graphql-on-azure-part-12-graphql-as-a-service/ba-p/3769306) provides an introduction to the new[Data API Builder for Azure Databases](https://aka.ms/dabdocs)(*DAB*) - currently in public preview - the underlying technology that provides an easy way to create REST or GraphQL endpoints to your existing Azure database without you having to write backend code.
2. [**Part 13: Using Data API builder with Azure Static Web Apps**](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/graphql-on-azure-part-13-using-data-api-builder-with-swa-and/ba-p/3769309) - next, take a look at how the DAB capability can be accessed seamlessly in your Azure Static Web App using the new [Database Connections](https://aka.ms/swa/db/announcement) feature and a React app example. (_Note_: Another [**upcoming post**](collections/dab#4-coming-soon-tutorial) in this collection will walk through the official React sample for SWA+DAB so stay tuned).
3. [**Part 14: Using Data API builder with SWA and Blazor**](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/graphql-on-azure-part-14-using-data-api-builder-with-swa-and/ba-p/3769316) Today, we want to feature this post which implements the same use case - the Trivia game shown below - as a **Blazor application** using the [Strawberry Shake NuGet package](https://chillicream.com/docs/strawberryshake/v13/get-started). | üëâüèΩ **[Explore the source](https://github.com/aaronpowell/dab-blazor-trivia-demo)**

## 4. Vue, React, Angular

:::success BOOKMARK: AZURE SAMPLES FOR DATA API BUILDER
The Azure Static Web Apps Database Connections feature uses the [Data API builder for Azure Databases](https://github.com/Azure/data-api-builder) to support REST and GraphQL endpoints for your deployed app. The [Azure-Samples/data-api-builder](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/data-api-builder) is a good resource to discover and explore _end-to-end_ samples using this feature. 
:::

Here are three samples showcasing Static Web Apps Database Connections:
 1. [**Vue + AzureSQL**](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/dab-swa-todo) - The well-known ToDo MVC application, built using Database connections and SWA.
 2. [**React + AzureSQL**](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/dab-swa-library-demo) - Organize track books with this sample app, built using Database connections and SWA.
 3. [**Angular + CosmosDB (NoSQL)**](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/dab-swa-wonders) - Tour world wonders in this app, built using Database connections and SWA.

## 5. Learn Best Practices

:::success BEST PRACTICES FOR USING DATABASE CONNECTIONS 

Want to connect your Azure Static Web Apps to your database? Should you use Azure Functions with a managed, serverless API interface? Or use Data API builder directly? Or use the new Database Connections feature in SWA that wraps it? _Let's learn about best practices_ when taking the decision.
:::

Today, we are sharing a new blog post from Static Web Apps PM Thomas Gauvin, that looks at this particular question. In particular, it helps you understand the choices between using Azure Functions (managed), Data API builder (direct) or Database Connections (seamless) options to connect your Azure Static Web App to your database.

But wait, there's more! Check out the recent [Azure SWA Community Standups](https://aka.ms/swa/community/standups) recording where Davide Mauri (Data API Builder PM) and Thomas Gauvin (SWA PM) discuss the new Database Connections feature and how it works - with more insights into best practices and usage.
