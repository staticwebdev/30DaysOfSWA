It would have been much easier for me to write about a specific topic with code examples and technical definitions, than describing what developer experience means to me.</p><p>The definition of developer experience, like anything else you <em>experience</em>, is subjective. It has a lot of you, in it. It changes with you, and the context you&#x27;re a part of. Things like <em>how long you&#x27;ve been in the business</em> or <em>what type of software you work on</em>, or <em>where do you deploy it</em>, will all impact your perception of an experience.</p><p>So how to put it in words? How to define it and scope it? </p><p>It&#x27;s impossible for me to do it in a way that feels relatable to everyone. I can only explain it, from the perspective inferred by my needs and my perception of the outcome, as an individual developer, and how it impacts my vision and my work. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="predictability">Predictability<a class="hash-link" href="#predictability" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Let me start by saying that in my personal life, when I think of memorable experiences, a lot of them have been the consequence of an impulse. A spontaneous act. In my personal life, I am not much of a planner. I am the kind of person that wakes up every Saturday morning and declares &quot;We are going somewhere far away this weekend!&quot;. And my husband (who is all the contrary from me and needs a lot of structure!) will ask questions like:</p><ul><li>Ok, where do you wanna go? </li><li>Have you booked a hotel? </li><li>Do you know where we will have lunch? </li></ul><p>And I would invariably respond: &quot;I don&#x27;t care! Let&#x27;s just hop in the car, drive somewhere and figure it all out on the way there!&quot;. That&#x27;s because I think that experimenting and experiencing, go hand in hand, when it comes to adventure. And the actual <em>way there</em>, is part of the fun.</p><blockquote><p><strong>At work, however, I like predictability.</strong> </p></blockquote><p>I like structure, repeatability, patterns &amp; conventions. I appreciate having a framework, an opinion others agree with so I&#x27;m on the same page with my team. And I like all this because it oftentimes leads to quick results and success.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="a-road-analogy">A Road Analogy<a class="hash-link" href="#a-road-analogy" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Experiences are like roads. They can take you places -- or not. And to me, <strong>development experiences are just like the roads we travel on</strong>:</p><ul><li>They have milestones - so I can measure progress.</li><li>They have multiple lanes - so I have flexibility.</li><li>They have entry and exit ramps - so I can change paths quickly. </li><li>They have destinations - so I know I&#x27;m getting somwhere specific.</li></ul><p>When I first got into web development, there were a fewer types of roads. Most were linear and slow, particularly when it came to frontend development. You needed repeated round-trips to the same server, just to get something to render on a page.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="the roundtrip road of boring development" src="/assets/images/swaF1-2f10c6d9065a83c8c963ec50a95e9c2e.png" width="2120" height="1181" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>By contrast, today we&#x27;re speeding along multi-lane freeways with numerous twists and turns, interconnecting roads, and possibilities (<a href="https://dev.to/azure/04-configuring-static-web-apps-2oa7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aka configurations</a>) to choose from. To reach a destination, you may have to use ramps to connect two different roads - similar to how we connect tow different services <a href="https://dev.to/azure/03-api-enabling-static-web-apps-25kh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via an API</a>. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="more lanes, more connectivity, more fun, more speed" src="/assets/images/swaF3-c85e864b2af858458f7034a071d45127.png" width="3331" height="1244" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>If we continue with this analogy, then <strong>a bad development experience is like poor road planning or construction</strong>:</p><ul><li>the road is old, bumpy, cracked</li><li>the signposts are few and far between, giving the user insufficient time to process and follow instructions. </li><li>if you miss an exit, you may have to travel a long distance before you have the opportunity to turn around</li><li>there may be no way to access a desired road from another one - no exit or entry ramps at all!</li><li>if your car breaks down, or your run out of fuel - there may not be service stations nearby to for refill or recharge.</li><li>or you may find a station, but you have no idea of the cost of refill or recharge before you commit to taking that exit.</li><li>there may not be any way to get food or drinks for many miles.</li></ul><p>You can probably guess how these travel constraints map onto poor developer experiences, but let&#x27;s spell it out:</p><ul><li>having to slow down due to infrastructure conditions</li><li>feeling like you&#x27;re not making any progress</li><li>having the certainty that your application quality is degrading due the environment and lack of resources or support, resulting in technical debt</li><li>not having the ability to <a href="https://dev.to/azure/05-securing-static-web-apps-5fe3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">secure your implementation</a></li><li>not finding the right, complete or fresh documentation to help you understand the best path</li><li>not having the right SDK&#x27;s, API methods, or means of integrating your app to other software, to accomplish simple or more complex tasks, like authentication, storage, content authoring <a href="https://dev.to/azure/12-headless-cms-swa-built-with-blazor-1e2d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with a headless CMS</a> or setting up your CI/CD pipeline</li><li>not having the right tools to <a href="https://dev.to/azure/02-building-static-web-apps-2j72" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build</a>, <a href="https://dev.to/azure/07-deploying-static-web-apps-48e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deploy</a>, optimize, <a href="https://dev.to/azure/06-previewing-static-web-apps-4p36" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">preview</a>, monitor or speed up your processes</li><li>not being able to scale or not being sure how much it will cost you</li><li>not having fun, as you go</li></ul><p><strong>Because, let&#x27;s face it: developing should be a fun experience.

And we can only make those decisions right, when we ask the right questions.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="architecture-what-core-infrastructure-capabilities-and-resources-do-we-need">Architecture: What core infrastructure, capabilities and resources do we need?<a class="hash-link" href="#architecture-what-core-infrastructure-capabilities-and-resources-do-we-need" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>As we hope you have learned from following this <a href="https://dev.to/azure/kicking-off-30daysofswa-2d8g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30 days of Static Web Apps</a>, it is a dedicated offering for frontend developers working with SPA&#x27;s and Static Generated websites. We continue to work to extend its capabilities, and support more frameworks and use cases.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="documentation-should-be-fresh--relevant">Documentation: Should be fresh &amp; relevant!<a class="hash-link" href="#documentation-should-be-fresh--relevant" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>When thinking about those milestones that should hit along the road of a great end-to-end developer experience, we are working hard to make sure you always find complete and fresh documentation to help you get started and know all the possibilities you have with Static Web Apps, upfront, and to keep supporting you with relevant documentation and content as your applications grow.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="workflows-building-blocks--seamless-integrations">Workflows: Building blocks &amp; seamless integrations!<a class="hash-link" href="#workflows-building-blocks--seamless-integrations" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Not only have we been working to offer an intuitive user interface at the Azure portal itself. We have been very intentional at the time of making sure integration with the <a href="https://dev.to/azure/15-develop-with-azure-tools-3h47" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tools</a>, and platforms frontend developers know, use and love, like GitHub and VS Code, is seamless. </p><p>Static Web Apps automatically pushes a GitHub actions workflow file as you generate the application as a resource, and you can create it from the portal, if you prefer a UI guided experience, but also without ever leaving your favorite code editor, by installing the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurestaticwebapps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official extension</a>!</p><p>And if you prefer a command line experience, you can use the brand new Static Web Apps CLI, with extended support to login to Azure, create, build and deploy apps, and a local emulator, so you can test your apps before you ever deploy to the cloud.</p><p>Creating your static web applications and configuring your pipelines, has never been this easy!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="efficient--versatile-serverless--containerized-apis">Efficient &amp; Versatile: Serverless + Containerized APIs<a class="hash-link" href="#efficient--versatile-serverless--containerized-apis" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Because we recognize that the use cases for Jamstack and JavaScript full-stacks applications in general are becoming more and more complex, part of our strategy for a delightful end-to-end development experience relies on the simplification and standarization of mechanisms for API integration, via serverless functions through industry compliant patterns and via our super efficient devkits.</p><p>And that includes a concern that has historically been a challenge for frontend developers: the integration with databases and data storage. Azure Static Web Apps is unique in that it integrates very well with our CosmosDB database, a versatile cloud database that offers different API&#x27;s to meet different developer skills and server a myriad of use cases in a very effective way.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="security--performance-e2e-testing--debugging">Security &amp; Performance: E2E testing + debugging<a class="hash-link" href="#security--performance-e2e-testing--debugging" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>And when we go to the service station, it may be a good time to check our oil levels, air pressure and wipe our window panes. And what a better way to do it than with tools from the same developer ecosystem and that play right (yes, you got me! I&#x27;m playing with words now!) like <a href="https://dev.to/azure/16-test-automation-with-playwright-odk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Playwright</a> and Edge Developer Tools. </p><p>So now when you use the newly release Preview environments, to test development from a specific staging branch, you will have also the ability to integrate with best-in-class tooling, iteration after iteration, until feature complete.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="alignment-the-ultimate-e2e-roadmap-should-map-to-the-development-cycle">Alignment: The ultimate e2e roadmap should <em>map</em> to the development cycle<a class="hash-link" href="#alignment-the-ultimate-e2e-roadmap-should-map-to-the-development-cycle" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Any aspect on its own, can describe an end-to-end experience. For instance:</p><ul><li>If I want to secure my app against unauthorized access, I must implement identity. That&#x27;s an E2E experience.</li><li>If I want to persist data, I&#x27;ll need to integrate with a database. An E2E experience.</li><li>If I want to integrate third-party services on demand, I&#x27;ll need event-driven functions. Another E2E experience.</li></ul><p>The ultimate end-to-end experience, however, is that that encompasses all components described by a matrix of architecture definitions and best practices,  mapping to the software development cycle itself.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="development roadmap equals cycle" src="/assets/images/SWAF5-bb8f52ffabf09a08d7f08a8f53f4463c.png" width="2283" height="1598" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>When we are in the system design phase for our application, we will start thinking about what in research is known as &quot;Jobs to be Done&quot;, and materialize them or <em>get them done</em> , using tools or integrating with other products or services.</p><p> <strong>Setup phase</strong>.
Job to be done will be generic - &quot;I need to build a static web app. </p><ul><li>What do I need? =&gt; I need a framework.</li><li>What does the framework require =&gt; It&#x27;s a JS framework that runs in the browser, or in a Node.js runtime. I need a node environment and a node package manager to manage dependencies. </li><li>Selected framework has its own CLI =&gt; I need it to optimize it and build it. </li><li>I want to version it, so I need a version control tool. To collaborate, I need to host that code in a central, remote location (aka version control hosting). </li><li>And because we want to build it remotely each time we integrate with a CI/CD pipeline, that includes a runner and some virtualization or emulation. - And we want to publish it, so I need a hosting service. </li><li>And...&quot;_</li></ul><p>And those are the <em>requirements</em> that we start mapping to <em>setup and service capabilities</em>, so we can put together local and remote environments capable to fulfill them.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="welcome-to-the-matrix">Welcome to the matrix<a class="hash-link" href="#welcome-to-the-matrix" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>So let&#x27;s do together an exercise of architecture definitions based out of developer <em>jobs to be done</em>, classifying them by the milestone we defined in the previous graphic. As a bonus, we will map them to a requirement, that can be a business requirement, a developer job to be done, or an end user story.</p><p>The matrix will be roughly based on the high-level diagram
